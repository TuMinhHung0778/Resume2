            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I'm a final-year Computer Science student passionate about building complete and scalable web
                applications.</p>
            <p>I work as a full-stack developer ‚Äî handling both frontend and backend. On the frontend, I mainly use
                ReactJS for modern, responsive interfaces. On the backend, I develop secure and efficient RESTful APIs
                using Node.js and Express.js with database systems like MySQL and MongoDB.</p>
            <p>I enjoy designing clean architectures, optimizing performance, and ensuring that each feature works
                smoothly from UI to database.</p>
            <p>I'm a self-taught developer who constantly learns, experiments, and improves through real-world projects
                and teamwork.</p>
            <p>My long-term goal is to become a Senior Fullstack Developer ‚Äî and my greatest strengths are strong
                self-learning skills and persistence in overcoming challenges and continuously improving myself.</p>
